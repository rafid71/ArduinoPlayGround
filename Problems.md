# Problems 

### 1 Write a Java program to get a number from the user and print whether it is positive or negative. Write a function that will take an input as integer value, and print the expected output.
  - Test Data Input number: 35
  - Expected Output : Number is positive

### 2 Write a Java program that takes three numbers from the user and prints the greatest number. Writer a function that will take three number as method parameters and print the greatest one.
  - Test Data Input the 1st number: 25
  - Input the 2nd number: 78
  - Input the 3rd number: 87
  - Expected Output : The greatest: 87

### 3 Write a Java program that reads a floating-point number and prints "zero" if the number is zero. Otherwise, print "positive" or "negative". Add "small" if the absolute value of the number is less than 1, or "large" if it exceeds 1,000,000.
  - Test Data Input a number: 25
  - Expected Output :
    - Input value: 25
    - Positive number
### 5. Write a Java program that takes a number from the user and generates an integer between 1 and 7. It displays the weekday name.

- Test Data Input number:
- 3 Expected Output : Wednesday

### 6. Write a Java program that reads two floating-point numbers and tests whether they are the same up to three decimal places.
- Test Data
  - Input floating-point number: 25.586
  - Input floating-point another number: 25.589
  - Expected Output : They are different

### 7. Write a Java program to find the number of days in a month.
- Test Data Input a month number: 2
- Input a year: 2016
- Expected Output : February 2016 has 29 days

### 8. Write a Java program that requires the user to enter a single character from the alphabet. Print Vowel or Consonant, depending on user input. If the user input is not a letter (between a and z or A and Z), or is a string of length > 1, print an error message.
- Test Data Input an alphabet: p
- Expected Output : 

### 9. Write a Java program that takes a year from the user and prints whether it is a leap year or not.
- Test Data Input the year: 2016
- Expected Output : 2016 is a leap year
