# Problems 

### 1 Write a Java program to get a number from the user and print whether it is positive or negative. Write a function that will take an input as integer value, and print the expected output.
  - Test Data Input number: 35
  - Expected Output : Number is positive

### 2 Write a Java program that takes three numbers from the user and prints the greatest number. Writer a function that will take three number as method parameters and print the greatest one.
  - Test Data Input the 1st number: 25
  - Input the 2nd number: 78
  - Input the 3rd number: 87
  - Expected Output : The greatest: 87

### 3 Write a Java program that reads a floating-point number and prints "zero" if the number is zero. Otherwise, print "positive" or "negative". Add "small" if the absolute value of the number is less than 1, or "large" if it exceeds 1,000,000.
  - Test Data Input a number: 25
  - Expected Output :
    - Input value: 25
    - Positive number
